"""
Acho-Corasick algorithm yields the best possible time complexity for the solution to the multi-string search problem
in the case when a fixed set of patterns and (many) variable-length string(s) is (are given).
The one-time construction of data structure by the set of patterns takes O(n) time, when n is the sum of all the
lengths of the pattern strings.  After that the search of all the patterns in a given string takes O(m + z) where
m is the length of the string and z is the number of the matches reported by the algorithm.

Some important applications of the algorithm are described here:
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.310.6746&rep=rep1&type=pdf

This implementation of slightly modified Aho-Corasick algorithm takes a list of pattern strings and a list of scores
for each pattern and efficiently builds a slightly modified Aho-Corasick structure that for a given string,
calculates the cumulative scores of each pattern substring in the string, i.e, the number of the occurrences of
of each pattern multiplied by the given scores of the pattern.  The pattern can be repeated with the different scores
in the pattern/scores lists.  All the occurrences of a pattern would be accounted for.
E.g., the pattern "aa" would be counted twice in "aaa".

Please see the tests for the detailed examples of the calculation requirements and the outputs.

A good lecture on the Aho-Corasick Algorithm is, for example, here:
